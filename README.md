# _Scrummed-Backend_ ðŸ’»

### **Scrummed** tool backend.

## Setting up the solution:

1. Check if you have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/es/) (package manager) installed. If not, download and install it.
2. Clone the repository.
3. Run `npm install` on the root folder (where package.json is located).
4. Run `npm start` to start the application. By default, it will run on _http://localhost:3000_.
5. Enjoy coding!ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Ž

> By default, this is configured to use [nodemon](https://nodemon.io/) to serve the application, so you won't need to stop & start the server every time a change is made.

## Commits nomenclature:
- "**Code**": for most common commits. Code changes, unittests, refactors, new functionalities, etc.
- "**Fix**": for solving bugs in the code.
- "**Core**": for including new libraries, packages, changes on the general architecture.

> Commits structure should be: "**(Type)** - **(Descriptive commit message)**."
