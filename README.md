# Scrumed-Backend ðŸ’»
The backend of a scrum tool with several functionalities

## Commits nomenclature:
- "Code": for most common commits. Code changes, unittests, refactors, new functionalities, etc.
- "Fix": for solving bugs in the code.
- "Core": for including new libraries, packages, changes on the general architecture.

Commits structure should be: "(Type) - (Descriptive commit message)."
  
## Setting up the solution:

1. Install NodeJS (package manager) from: https://nodejs.org/es/.
2. Clone the repository.
3. Run "npm install" on the root folder (where package.json is located).
4. Run "npm start" to start the application. By default, it will run on http://localhost:3000.
5. Enjoy coding!ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Ž

*This is configured to use nodemon to serve the application, so you won't need to stop & start the server every time a change is made.
